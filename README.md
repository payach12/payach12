# I'm Pooja! Welcome to my portfolio! :)

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
I'm currently a grad student at the University of Washington, majoring in Data Science and Epidemiology. My work spans across various domains, including but not limited to healthcare, public health, social media analytics, and consumer behavior. My passion for data science stems from wanting to tell stories and bridging gaps; over the last couple of years, I've really come to enjoy the science and application of statistics and machine learning. The possibilities are truly endless and exciting! I am driven to pursue a career in data science where I can effectively translate complex data and business insights into understandable and engaging stories, and narrarives that are both impactful and easy to grasp for all.

When I'm not playing around with data, I spend my time running, playing badminton, climbing, traveling and hiking, baking elaborate cakes (my toxic trait is thinking I could win Masterchef Australia-trust me, I have speech planned out and everything), and collecting cat memes from the internet. I was a Carnatic vocalist for 12 years, and it remains one of my biggest accomplishments till date. I love photography (check out the Pictures tab if you have the time!), I deeply enjoy going down pop culture rabbit holes, and hosting potlucks with my friends. Most importantly, I love being a cat mom to my sweet boy, Kush.

I love connecting with people, sharing ideas, and exploring new opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, discussions, or just a friendly chat about the exciting world of data. Thanks for being here! :)
