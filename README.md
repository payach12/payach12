## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm Pooja, currently a grad student at the University of Washington, majoring in Data Science and Epidemiology. My work spans across various domains, including but not limited to healthcare, public health, social media analytics, and consumer behavior. My passion for data science stems from wanting to tell stories and bridging gaps; over the last couple of years, I've really come to enjoy the science and application of statistics and machine learning. The possibilities are truly endless and exciting! I am driven to pursue a career in data science where I can effectively translate complex data and business insights into understandable and engaging stories, and narrarives that are both impactful and easy to grasp for all.
