# Welcome to my portfolio! :)


## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi! My name is Pooja Ayachit, and I recently graduated from the University of Washington with a Master's in Data Science, specializing in Mixed-Methods Research. Welcome to my page! 

My journey into Data Science is driven by a fascination with the stories that shape our lives—the wins, struggles, and connections that define us. I believe that behind every dataset is a narrative waiting to be discovered, and I’m passionate about blending my analytical skills with a deep curiosity about human experiences.

As a data scientist and mixed-methods researcher at the University of Washington, I explore various fields like product development, healthcare, social media, and consumer behavior. I strive to make data come alive by integrating quantitative and qualitative insights, revealing the underlying stories that numbers alone can’t tell. My goal is to ensure that data is more than just statistics; it's a reflection of real-world experiences and a tool for meaningful change.

📌 Building and deploying Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Recommendation Systems.

📌 Creating scalable data pipelines and ETL processes.

📌 Experimentation, such as A/B testing, Power Analysis, and Causal Inference.

📌 Data Visualization and Business Intelligence using Tableau and Power BI.

📌 User Experience Research and Product Strategy.

📌 Project Management and Agile Methodologies.

📌 Product Roadmapping & Management.
